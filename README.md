# SEP11 Freedom Project
by Bonnie Lei

## Context
The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is all about making an interactive program using Javascript. The purpose of this blog is to record my process into creating one.

## Content
For my project, I am making a website that can help me store my passwords. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying Firebase in order to make the website.
