  I've decided on using Firebase for my project. Why I chose Firebase was because it can help me store data and my project needs to store some passwords and usernames. Well, it already said that it needs to store usernames and password for my accounts, so whenever I sign in to a website, either after I type my username, it will autofill in the password or it fills in both if I can't remenber the username either.
  
  Right now on the stage of defining and research the problem. I know what problem I'm trying to solve here, but I still need to learn more about it, so need more researching.
