  I've decided on using Firebase for my project. Why I chose Firebase was because it can help me store data and my project needs to store passwords and usernames. Well, it already said that it needs to store usernames and password for my accounts, so whenever I sign in to a website, either after I type my username, it will autofill in the password or it fills in both if I can't remenber the username either.
  
  I have to say [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) helped me learned a lot. Now I know to to store informations just by assigning to a variable and this may be useful when I create my project. I've also been using [JSbin](https://jsbin.com/?js,output) to help me test out temporary codes. When I found some codes in Firebase, I will copy and paste it into JSbin and see what it does, but usually it shows an error.
  
  Right now on the stage of engineering design process is defining the problem and research the problem. I know what problem I'm trying to solve here, but I still need to learn more about it, so need more researching. I will continue on the research the problems and the next stage would be brainstorm possible solutions. After I think I have enough informations, I will start to brainstorms how I can create my product. Two skills I developed in this process were how to learn and how to google. How to learn was I had to go through Firebase and learn what's in there that can help me with my project. I also try some codes in there and see if I can understand and break it down. How to google was when I'm confuse with one thing in Firebase I will google what it is and building on to it.
