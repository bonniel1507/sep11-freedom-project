For this project, me and my partner had made a plan for a basic design of the website our project is on. We first made a [plan](https://github.com/yukiz3256/passwordsaver/blob/main/plan.md) on the basic components our website will need. We use this [tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup) to help us set up a firebase in our web page. We watched the youtube video that's shown in the tutorial, we were following it for what to do. We did the first step, which was to copy and paste the nmp to the terminal of our website. It just downloaded a bunch of stuff, it's folders in folders in folders, etc. So, I'm having a hard time to understanding it. I actually don't know what to do, so I follow what they tell me to do, I copy and paste they code they give us. I changed some of the words to the function I need after watching the video and have a little better understanding of it. For step 2, which I don't understand, I commented out the code for now, so it's not having an error. I'm using this [website](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/learn-more#config-object) to help me. Only half way through at step 3 right now, I will try to figure it out.

For the Engineering Design Process, I'm on the stage of "Brainstorm possible solutions" and "Plan the most promising solution", me and my partner each contributed some of our ideas and we make a plan on our website. We will continue to learn so we can be ready for our next stage. I developed the skill of collaboration, which me and my partner were working together to get the most out of us. The other skill was communication. We talked about how our website should look like, what it needs and if our ideas were necessary, would that add in extra work for us and can we complete the website by the end of the school year.
