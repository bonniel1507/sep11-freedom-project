### Context

This project was created for people who kept forgetting their passwords. There are websites that require you to sign-in with username and password and it must contain letters, numbers and symbol. So, it's easy to forget it when you login and had to reset everytime. This was what happened to me, whenever I have to login into CollegeBoard, I always forget my username and password. I have to ask them to send me an email telling what my username is and then use the username to reset the password. That's what inspired me to make this project. This project was created using FIrebase and it's main purpose it to help you store data. Even though it was the hardest tool to be using, but if I want to create my project, I have to use it. And I came up to my partner and we worked together, since we are going to using the same tool.

### Content

In the biggining, me and my partner was struggling becasue we don't understand and we didn't realize that we were using wrong tutorials. Those videos was for the older verison of Firebase. And those confused us because we tried it and it's not working. We went through many videos and we have many useless codes in our project. We have to go up to someone for help. We got very useful videos on Youtube thats about Firebase 9. It's also difficult for us because we can only message each other through text messages and having other things that doesn't allow us to work on it the same time. She works on it at the morning while I was asleep, when I woke up she has work. And until she can work on it at night, it's the end of the day for me. So, other than test messages, we created a Google Doc and put our process in there and explain the purpose of the code we individually added. This is the [product](https://bonniel1507.github.io/the-pass-saver/dist/index.html) we have. We tested our website mutiple times and it's working, it wasn't fully prefect compare to what we thought it would be. We have something at the end at least.

We had an expo in the cafeteria and we present our websites to vistors and some classes that came with their teacheres. I was so nervous sitting there. Me and my partner combined our elevator pitch and we decieded to take turns presenting and if either of us miss something, the other one would add in. We watch the judges getting closer to our number and I regconized one of the judges. They got to our nomber and I was the one presenting, there was a little trip while presenting, but it was going well at the end. When they were done, I went to the other side and saw some of the seniors' project, it was nice and I saw some of my classmates too. We also have an inclass presentation to do. Ws made a [Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kFnqtOINyyFJVw7nvAxm51T08Z0EVepC-RNjnmVNmig/edit?usp=sharing) to explai  our process to the class. I feel like we were so under prepare for the slides. I was also glad that I have a partner because for one slide I didn't explain well enough, but she comes in and explain it for me.

### Implication

#### Pro:
Helps people to save passwords they forgets. So, people can avoid reseting their password everything they forget.

#### Con:
It's kind of dangerous to have your passwords online. It may got stolen or viewed by a stranger. This one you also needs to use a device to login and acess the data, so without connection, you can't see your data.

The engineering design process we are at was Improve as needed. Base of the feedbacks we get from people we dicuss on adding more improvement to the project. Then we would communicate how did our improvements go. The skills I developed were and communication and creativity. Because me and my partner were thrown off by other stuff, so we got to be good at communticating by texts. Also with creativity, since we were adding improvements, we have to think of ways we can add. To make the website more interesting and easier for people to use.
