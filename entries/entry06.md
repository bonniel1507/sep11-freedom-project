### Context

This project was created for people who kept forgetting their passwords. There are websites that require you to sign-in with username and password and it must contain letters, numbers and symbol. So, it's easy to forget it when you login and had to reset everytime. This was what happened to me, whenever I have to login into CollegeBoard, I always forget my username and password. I have to ask them to send me an email telling what my username is and then use the username to reset the password. That's what inspired me to make this project. This project was created using FIrebase and it's main purpose it to help you store data. Even though it was the hardest tool to be using, but if I want to create my project, I have to use it. And I came up to my partner and we worked together, since we are going to using the same tool.

### Content

In the biggining, me and my partner was struggling becasue we don't understand and we didn't realize that we were using wrong tutorials. Those videos was for the older verison of Firebase. And those confused us because we tried it and it's not working. We went through many videos and we have many useless codes in our project. We have to go up to someone for help. We got very useful videos on Youtube thats about Firebase 9. It's also difficult for us because we have to message each other through text messages and having other things that doesn't allow us to work on it the same time. So, other than test messages, we created a Google Doc and put our process in there and explain the purpose of the code we individually added. We have something at the end at least.
